# CSharp-Program-Delivery-Cost-Form

C# program written by William Blevins for CIS 199

This C# program creates a form to accept shipping details such as mile, weight, and delivery days. Form uses nested if statements to calculate and display shipping costs for three companies, then outputs which shipping cost is lowest.
